Kyle went to go pick-up his pc from the repair shop when BRATWURSTS started to fall from the sky.
He did not know when he would be back since he went all the way to BERLIN to get it.
Trying to dodge the sausages raining from the sky, he ran into a nearby RATSKELLER. 
He was feeling overwhelmed so he ate the DÃ¶ner in his pocket. 
It was so good that he threw off his shirt and ran down the Hauptstrasse laughing with joy.
The smell from the kebabs in his pocket attracted some HUNDS.
Kyle could not outrun the hunds because his LEDERHOSE were too tight.
Miracuously, a Porche pulled up in front of him, which he managed to barely enter before being mauled.
Kyle's savior fancied him so he drove him to a BIERGARTEN for a date.
They were feeling WETTBERWERBSFAEHIG so they put on their DIRNDLS and drank their opponents under the table.
Their opponents did not appreciate this one bit, no sir, mhm, nope, nuh uh.
